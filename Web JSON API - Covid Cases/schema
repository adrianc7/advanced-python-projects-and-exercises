death
Field type:integer
Deaths (confirmed and probable)

Total fatalities with confirmed OR probable COVID-19 case diagnosis (per the expanded CSTE case definition of April 5th, 2020 approved by the CDC). In some states, these individuals must also have COVID-19 listed on the death certificate to count as a COVID-19 death. When states post multiple numbers for fatalities, the metric includes only deaths with COVID-19 listed on the death certificate, unless deaths among cases is a more reliable metric in the state.

Returns

In some states, these individuals must also have COVID-19 listed on the death certificate to count as a COVID-19 death. When states post multiple numbers for confirmed fatalities, the metric includes only lab-confirmed deaths with COVID-19 listed on the death certificate, unless deaths among confirmed cases is a more reliable metric in the state.

Negative PCR tests (people)

Total number of unique people with a completed PCR test that returns negative. For states / territories that do not report this number directly, we compute it using one of several methods, depending on which data points the state provides.

Field type:integer
Cases (confirmed plus probable)

Total number of confirmed plus probable cases of COVID-19 reported by the state or territory, ideally per the August 5, 2020 CSTE case definition. Some states are following the older April 5th, 2020 CSTE case definition or using their own custom definitions. Not all states and territories report probable cases. If a state is not reporting probable cases, this field will just represent confirmed cases.

Returns

Field type:integer
Confirmed Cases

Total number of unique people with a positive PCR or other approved nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), as reported by the state or territory. This is equivalent to a confirmed case as per the CSTE case definitions of August 5th, 2020 and April 5th, 2020. If we discover a jurisdiction is labeling cases as confirmed using other evidence (e.g. positive antigen tests), we will annotate that state or territory’s data accordingly.

probableCases
Field type:integer
Probable Cases

Total number of probable cases of COVID-19 as reported by the state or territory, ideally per the August 5, 2020 CSTE case definition. By this definition, a probable case is someone who tests positive via antigen without a positive PCR or other approved nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), someone with clinical and epidemiological evidence of COVID-19 infection with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for SARS-CoV-2, or someone with COVID-19 listed on their death certificate with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for SARS-CoV-2. Some states are following the older April 5th, 2020 CSTE case definition or using their own custom definitions.

Returns
null

recovered
Field type:integer
Recovered

Total number of people that are identified as recovered from COVID-19. States provide very disparate definitions on what constitutes a “recovered” COVID-19 case. Types of “recovered” cases include those who are discharged from hospitals, released from isolation after meeting CDC guidance on symptoms cessation, or those who have not been identified as fatalities after a number of days (30 or more) post disease onset. Specifics vary for each state or territory.

totalTestEncountersViral
Field type:integer
Total PCR tests (test encounters)

Total number of people tested per day via PCR testing as reported by the state or territory. The count for this metric is incremented up by one for each day on which an individual person is tested, no matter how many specimens are collected from that person on that day. If an individual person is tested twice a day on three different days, this count will increment up by three. If we discover that a jurisdiction is including antigen tests in this metric, we will annotate that state or territory’s data accordingly.

Returns
null
if no data is available
totalTestResults
Field type:integer
Total test results

At the national level, this metric is a summary statistic which, because of the variation in test reporting methods, is at best an estimate of US viral (PCR) testing. Some states/territories report tests in units of test encounters, some report tests in units of specimens, and some report tests in units of unique people. Moreover, some jurisdictions include antigen tests in their total test counts without reporting a separate total of viral (PCR) tests. Therefore, this value is an aggregate calculation of heterogeneous figures. Please consult each state or territory’s individual data page to see whether that jurisdiction lumps antigen and PCR tests together and to see what units that jurisdiction uses for test reporting.

In most states, the totalTestResults field is currently computed by adding positive and negative values because, historically, some states do not report totals, and to work around different reporting cadences for cases and tests. In Colorado, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin, where reliable testing encounters figures are available with a complete time series, we directly report those figures in this field. In Alaska, America Samoa, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming, where reliable specimens figures are available with a complete time series, we directly report those figures in this field. In Alabama and Idaho where reliable unique people figures are available with a complete time series, we directly report those figures in this field. We are in the process of switching all states over to use directly reported total figures, using a policy of preferring testing encounters, specimens, and people, in that order.

Returns

totalTestsPeopleViral
Field type:integer
Total PCR tests (people)

Total number of unique people tested at least once via PCR testing, as reported by the state or territory. The count for this metric is incremented up only the first time an individual person is tested and their result is reported. Future tests of the same person will not be added to this count.

In the case where the state only provides negative cases, this field is calculated as the summation of people who tested positive (“Positive Cases (People”) and the number of people who tested negative (“Negative (People or Cases)”). If we discover that a jurisdiction is including antigen tests in this metric, we will annotate that state or territory’s data accordingly.

Returns
null
if no data is available
totalTestsViral
Field type:integer
Total PCR tests (specimens)

Total number of PCR tests (or specimens tested) as reported by the state or territory. The count for this metric is incremented up each time a specimen is tested and the result is reported. If we discover that a jurisdiction is including antigen tests in this metric, we will annotate that state or territory’s data accordingly. For states with ambiguous annotations, we have assigned their total tests to this category; these states and territories are identified in the new API field covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits as having “Unclear units.”
